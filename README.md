\As an intern at Rhombix Technologies, I analyzed Kaggle’s Titanic dataset to find survival patterns. By exploring demographics and engineering features like family size and fare bins, I improved model predictions. Visuals clarified data trends, and classification modeling enhanced my machine learning skills—a great intro to data science!
